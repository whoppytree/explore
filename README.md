# Megan's "Art" Gallery
Welcome to my exhibit! Join me in navigating my photo gallery as I attempt to make sense of whatever's in there. Believe me, I'm just as confused as you are.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
### Exhibit A
![img1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194469369-859c7404-3e82-47cd-b6d2-b778fd788aba.jpg)
A fairly normal start. A photo taken at a cafe mere minutes after I left the orthodontist, just after acquiring braces and being thoroughly lectured on edibles henceforth prohibited (with strong emphasis on sugary foods). As can be seen I have very high regard for such things, being the esteemed individual that I am. The subject of this photo however is an intricate culinary phenomenon. To this day, its flavor is unidentifiable. Be it, matcha, green apple, honeydew, or some other "green" flavor, no one knows. A true enigma of its kind to all connoisseurs alike.

### Exhibit B

Possibly the worst misspelling of my name I've encountered my entire life. I honestly don't know if this was done on purpose, by mistake, or because the cashier knows a Maegan in their life. I'm sure it is a name that exists, but it's just so jarring to me because it's the first time I've ever seen it spelled it that way. Either it is uncommon or I simply live under a rock... speaking from experience, it's probably the latter.

### Exhibit C
![img3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194471907-5e6ca931-7f77-4901-8e4d-06b9e5e90b66.jpg)
Now just who could these mysterious strangers be? A photo taken on an especially auspicious Friday occasion after I supposedly left my phone on one of the park benches of Don Kuh-nah be Regional Park (is that even how you say it?) To this day I'm still not even sure as to how it happened.

### Exhibit D
![img4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194472518-2492aa1c-7c7d-4f58-8484-0b1798cb3607.JPG)
Kirby, what happened to you!?                                                                                                                                             
Kirby: You mean I've been turned into a marketable drink? NOOOOOOOOO!!

Jokes aside, it was pretty good. It tasted like liquid candy which was nice, but it was a bit too sweet for my tastes.

### Exhibit E
![img5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194473274-f2f3ed0e-1f7a-4d54-9514-54a796e3c174.jpg)
There is no explanation for this.

### Exhibit F
![img6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194473510-564b54fa-68a6-4cf6-9f10-36c5d55d4357.jpg)
My pet fish whom I cherish very dearly. It's funny because my dad originally bought shrimp, when a few months later this fish randomly appeared in the tank. My guess is that an egg somehow snuck its way in the bag the shrimp were shipped in, or was caught in the various aquatic plants that we purchased. Regardless I'm happy it's here with us!

### Exhibit G
![img7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194474059-282c7999-14ed-43e3-bcaa-fd49a9a51286.JPG)

A very useful contraption. I too feel the inexplicable need to wipe my tears using toilet paper earrings. *Seriously, I find the most random things on Twitter...*

### Exhibit H
![img8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194475091-c2680f9e-1e0b-4b0f-8316-d75823b9ecc0.jpg)
A photo taken in Ms. Machado's room shortly after taking the AP Statistics exam. I honestly have no idea what's going on here.

### Exhibit I
![img9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114502873/194475483-3eef3b35-a4ac-42ef-af96-e71c9b30c0be.jpg)
First time seeing a limousine in person. For a second I almost thought I was seeing things. It just looks so interesting...

And that concludes the exhibit! I applaud you for having reached this far in all its unhinged glory. Cheers, and I'll see you next time for part 2!
