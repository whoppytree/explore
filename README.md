# Megan's "Art" Gallery
Welcome to my exhibit! Join me in navigating my photo gallery as I attempt to make sense of whatever's in there. Believe me, I'm just as confused as you are.
### Exhibit A

A fairly normal start. A photo taken at a cafe mere minutes after I left the orthodontist, just after acquiring braces and being thoroughly lectured on edibles henceforth prohibited (with strong emphasis on sugary foods). As can be seen I have very high regard for such things, being the esteemed individual that I am. The subject of this photo however is an intricate culinary phenomenon. To this day, its flavor is unidentifiable. Be it, matcha, green apple, honeydew, or some other "green" flavor, no one knows. A true enigma of its kind to all connoisseurs alike.
